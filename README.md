Some R scripts to process and plot research data.

These scripts were created to process and plot the research data 
collected via questionnaires by Vasiliki Aggelopoulou for her master thesis
"Education of Adult Members of Socially Vulnerable Groups: Exploring Educational Needs"
(2014).

The answers data (csv files) are not public, therefore they are not commited in this github repo.
